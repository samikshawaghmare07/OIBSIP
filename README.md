This repository contains web development and programming projects completed during my internship in OIBSIP web develoment and designing. 
The main goal of these projects was to gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java by developing practical applications and documenting them systematically.

These projects also helped in understanding front-end design, interactivity, and basic authentication logic.

Objectives: 
Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals through real projects.
Develop basic interactivity and logic in web applications.
Document and maintain projects professionally on GitHub.

Tools used:
Vs code, Web browser (chrome), HTML5, CSS3, JAVA, JS

*Project details:

*Implementation Steps:

Created calculator layout using HTML.
Styled UI with CSS.
Added number and operator buttons.
Implemented JS logic for calculations.

*Outcome: A functional calculator with working operations. Learned DOM manipulation and JS conditions.

TASK 2 : Tribute Page (Dr. B. R. Ambedkar)

*Objective: Design a responsive tribute webpage with interactive features.

*Implementation Steps:

Structured content about Dr. Ambedkar’s life and works.
Styled the page with CSS using a blue-themed palette.

TASK 4 : Login Authentication System (Java)

*Objective: Understand basic authentication and Java programming fundamentals.

*Implementation Steps:

Created Java class for user registration and login.
Implemented validation using conditional statements.
Tested login access via terminal/IDE.

*Outcome: Console-based authentication system. Gained knowledge of Java logic and program flow.

^ overall outcome: Gained practical knowledge of front-end web development and learned JavaScript logic, event handling, and real practicality of internship and projects.


___These internship projects gave me hands-on experience in web development and programming. They helped me understand the entire workflow from building to deploying projects and also improved my technical and documentation skills.___

This repository contains web development and programming projects completed during my internship in OIBSIP web develoment and designing. 
The main goal of these projects was to gain hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java by developing practical applications and documenting them systematically.

These projects also helped in understanding front-end design, interactivity, and basic authentication logic.

Objectives: 
Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals through real projects.
Develop basic interactivity and logic in web applications.
Document and maintain projects professionally on GitHub.

Tools used:
Vs code, Web browser (chrome), HTML5, CSS3, JAVA, JS
